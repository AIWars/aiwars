# A.I. Wars
This project is dedicated to a remake of [A.I Wars](http://www.tacticalneuronics.com/content/aiw3dnew.asp),
In the game, you program a cyborg bug (cybug) with commands to navigate a 2-dimensional board,
destroying other bugs and avoiding obstacles. The game is turn-based with each action executed
representing your turn.

This reboot project is a new codebase to run the original cybug syntax on various platforms
including in the browser and possibly as a pure python app. The original game is only distributed
via EXE, which limits gameplay to many other operating systems. Original programs from
[the library]( http://www.tacticalneuronics.com/CybugLibrary/CybugsAppMainFrame.asp) should run
correctly within this project.

Issues (as in bugs, not cybugs) should be filed in the [issue tracker](
https://github.com/bmbouter/aiwars/issues).

As a kid I enjoyed playing this game a lot. It was a fun way to program and resulted in a lifelong
interest in software. I want to make that experience available to a new generation which could
consume the software via the web. I would like to thank the original author John Reder for
originally creating the game and granting me the permission to remake it.
